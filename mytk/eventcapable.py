"""
event_capable.py â€” Event mixin class for widget behavior

Provides the `EventCapable` class, a mixin designed to add event-related
capabilities to GUI widgets that expose a `widget` attribute compatible with
`tk.Widget`. This includes scheduling timed callbacks, cancelling them, and
binding or generating Tkinter events.

It is used for Base and App, which handle their widgets differently.

Also includes the `HasWidget` protocol to allow static checking of widget
presence for type-checkers.
